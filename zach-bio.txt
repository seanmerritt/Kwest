My name is Zach and I am 24 years old. 
I am a software engineering major and this is my 3rd semester in this field. 
I am not entirely sure what I would like to do for my career but I do enjoy working with websited and cybersecurity.
In my free time I like to play guitar, play video games, and mess with programs such as blender, photoshop, unity, exedra.
