Story:
A long time ago in a Galaxy far, far away . . .
Some random aliens decided that they wanted El Dorado’s greatest treasure, the “Golden Man,” whatever the heck that’s supposed to be.
After lightyears of travel, those aliens have finally reached Earth and are on the hunt.
But if anyone’s going to steal some giant golden man from some old gold city, it’s going to be one of our own that LIVES HERE, thank you VERY much.
What’s that?
I don’t CARE if we thought it was just a legend until now.
Yeah, yeah, okay, I know – we haven’t been able to find it after centuries of looking, but we’re a lot more motivated now AREN’T WE?
Sorry, you’ll have to speak up.
Oh. Why send you? Um. Well – We heard you were like, REALLY into Drake’s Fortune from the Uncharted series.
Don’t think about it too much, ‘kay?
 . . . Just shut up and go find the stupid gold statue or whatever already. 

Features:
Blocks, latters, puzzles(not quite sure what these will be), HP, side controls, shooting, enemies 

Game Mechanics:
* Controls- Use the arrow keys to move. Once you obtaini the power gem, you can use the space bar to shoot enemies. Pressing the "Esc" button any time will allow you to pause the game. 
* Health- Mushrooms give you 3 points of health. Obtaining fifty coins also gives you 3 points of health.
* Shooting- Enemies shoot at the player in synchronized intervals. Their bullets are disappear when they make contact with a wall or a tombstone.
* Tombstones- Tombstones appear when an enemy's health reaches zero. The player can hide behind tombstones to avoid enemy fire.
* Invisible enemies- As the player utilties the power gem and takes out enemies with energy blasts, the enemies get smarter and turn invisible. Tombstones still appear when they are taken out though.

Instructions:
Using the controls; leap over gaps, travers floating platforms, climb ladders, and take out enemies as you make your way through the level. Collect as many coins along the way and take out as many enemies as you can as fast as you can. The number of enemies killed, coins collected, and time spent will be displayed once the game is won.
